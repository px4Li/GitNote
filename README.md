- A quick history of Git
  - ***Linus Torvalds*** is the creator and main developer behind Linux and Git!
  - Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux Kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.
  - On April 3rd 2005 he got to work on his own VCS, which would become Git. In a matter of days he had most basic functionality done.
  - The first official Git release came a couple months later. 15 years later in 2020, over 90% of developers worldwide use Git on a daily basis!
  - He referred to Git as "the stupid content tracker" while he was working on it. Eventually he settled on the name Git which means "unpleasant persion" in British Snglish slang.
- Who use Git?
  - Engineers and Coders
  - Tech-Adjacent Roles
  - Governments
  - Scientists
  - Writers
  - Anyone
